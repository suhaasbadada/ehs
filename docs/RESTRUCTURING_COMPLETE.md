# RESTRUCTURING COMPLETE ✅

## Summary of Changes

The entire codebase has been successfully restructured into a professional, enterprise-grade folder organization.

### Directories Created

#### Source Code (`src/`)
This file was an internal summary generated during the repository restructuring. The authoritative and human-facing documentation lives in:

- `README.md` — project overview and quick start
- `STRUCTURE.md` — canonical project layout and module responsibilities
- `docs/` — architecture and security details

To keep the repository tidy, this intermediate summary has been consolidated. If you need the original extended restructuring notes, open an issue and I can restore the archived content into `docs/archive/`.
✅ Documentation generated
✅ Configuration files created
✅ Main demo tested and working
✅ All tests passing
✅ No breaking changes to functionality

## Next Steps

1. Run `python final_demo.py` to verify everything works
2. Run unit tests to validate individual components
3. Check out `STRUCTURE.md` for complete structure overview
4. Review `RUN_COMMANDS.md` for available commands
5. Explore documentation in `docs/` directory

The system is now professionally organized and ready for production use!
